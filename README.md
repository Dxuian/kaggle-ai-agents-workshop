# kaggle-ai-agents-workshop  
*Kaggle × Google 5-Day AI Agents Intensive*

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation and experiments from the **Kaggle × Google 5-Day AI Agents Intensive**, focused on building **LLM-powered multi-agent systems** using **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.

The project demonstrates how autonomous agents can be orchestrated to plan, reason, and execute tasks collaboratively using tool calling, memory, and structured workflows.
